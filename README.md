# Scientific Blog


Creating a plugin for writing blogs instead of pdf documents. The goal is to be able to easily reference contents in other posts as well as creating and managing sections, subsections. 

We also care about referencing and labeling:
 - Theorems,Lemmas,Propositions
 - Exercises
 

Automatic styling and javascript for hidden boxes:
 - toggle show/hide proofs
 - toggle show/hide solutions



In the future I will want to implement easy ways to write code and add it to each post.
